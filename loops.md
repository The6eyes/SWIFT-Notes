# Loops

You would use loops to do something a certain number of times. Loops are also used iterate over a collection.

For examples

First we'll make an array:
```swift
let teamBron = ["James", "Davis", "Harden","Doncic","Leonard"]
```

Now we can put the keyword for and then name whatever we want the items in our array to be called, in this case we will call them player.

```swift
for player in teamBron {
    print(player)
```
