# Enum

The simplest explantion of what an Enum is a group values that are related. 

To make an enum we must use the keyword `enum` and then name it something. Inside the scope is where we have our different cases. 

here is a basic example 

```swift
enum DayofWeek  {
    case monday
    case tuesday
    case wednesday
    case thursday
    case friday
    case saturday
    case sunday
}
```
