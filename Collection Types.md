# Collection Types 

We use collection types to store lists of data. There are three basic collection types: `arrays` `sets` and `dictionary`

# Arrays 

Definition: Container or list of objects. They start at 0 btw. They also go in order by the order it was inputed.

For example:

We can first establish a few constants

```swift
let naruto = naruto
let sasuke = sasuke
let sakura = sakura
```
