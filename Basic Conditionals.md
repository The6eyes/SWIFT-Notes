# Conditionals

You can give swift a condition and if that condition is true it will run code of our choice

For example:
We can declare some variables and then create 

```swift
let firstCard = 10
let secondCard = 11

if (firstCard + secondCard) == 21 {
    print("Blackjack!")
}
else    {
    print("You lose!")
}

if true && false && true {
    print("this can work with 3")
} else {
    print("one was false")
}
```
